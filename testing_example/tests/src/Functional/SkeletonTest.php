 * initially set up to fail. You have to modify the testFail() method to see the
 * fail.
 *
 * Each part of this test is required, and has comments explaining why it's
 * there.
 *
 * You can run this test using either phpunit or run-tests.sh. To use phpunit to
 * make sure the test is discovered, you can call it like this:
 *
 * @code
 * cd drupal/root
 * SIMPLETEST_BASE_URL=http://example.com/ ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c core/ --testsuite functional --filter SkeletonTest
 * @endcode
 *
 * For run-tests.sh:
 *
 * @code
 * cd drupal/root
 * php ./core/scripts/run-tests.sh --browser --url http://example.com --types PHPUnit-Functional testing_example
 * @endcode
 *
 * All tests must have a least one group annotation. run-tests.sh uses the first
 * one only.
 *
 * @group testing_example
 * @group examples
