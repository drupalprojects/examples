; Since someone might install our module through Composer, we want to be sure
; that the Drupal Composer facade knows we're specifying a core module rather
; than a project. We do this by namespacing the dependency name with drupal:.
dependencies[] = drupal:block
; Since the namespacing feature is new as of Drupal 7.40, we have to require at
; least that version of core.
