 * Demonstrates how a module can use the Cache API.
 *
 * Cache API allows us to cache data that is heavy to calculate. As this can
 * significantly speed up the Drupal site, it is recommended to use cache
 * mechanism when it is appropriate.
 *
 * Cache in Drupal is very easy to use. This example will search entire Drupal
 * folder and display all files. Since this operation includes filesystem it can
 * take a while. This list will not change much on production
 * websites, so we decide to cache it.
